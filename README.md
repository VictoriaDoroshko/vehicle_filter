# Vehicle Filters Project

This project is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to filter and display various car models.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to clone the repository and install all dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone git@github.com:VictoriaDoroshko/vehicle_filter.git](https://github.com/VictoriaDoroshko/vehicle_filter.git)
cd vehicle-filters

### Key Points:

1. **Installing Dependencies**: Ensure you have `Node.js` installed. If not, download and install it from the official site.
   
2. **API Keys and Configuration**: Be sure to add any necessary environment variables in `.env.local` for proper API communication. This file should not be committed to the repository, so be sure to include it in `.gitignore`.

3. **Development Mode**: The `npm run dev` command starts the development server, allowing you to make changes and see them reflected instantly.

4. **Production Mode**: Before deploying, use `npm run build` to prepare the app for production. This optimizes the app for a production environment.

This `README.md` should cover the essential steps to set up and run your project. You can expand it with other details as needed.
